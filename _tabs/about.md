Hi, I’m Mo.

I use this site to publish short notes, project writeups, and things I learn while building.

## What you’ll find here
- Engineering notes (practical, copy/paste-friendly)
- Project writeups (what I built, trade-offs, results)
- Occasional updates

## Now
I’m currently focusing on building a clean personal site and turning it into a consistent blog.
