I’m an SRE with 10+ years of experience, focused on building reliable, scalable systems—and making production calmer and more predictable. I enjoy building things and coding just as much as operations: automation, tooling, and small improvements that remove friction.

I’m also very interested in security and digital privacy, and how they intersect with modern infrastructure and everyday engineering.

## What you’ll find here
- Engineering notes (practical, copy/paste-friendly)
- Project writeups (what I built, trade-offs, results)
- Occasional updates

## Now
I’m currently focusing on building a clean personal site and turning it into a consistent blog.
