I’m an SRE with 10+ years of experience, focused on building reliable, scalable systems—and making production calmer and more predictable. I enjoy building things and coding just as much as operations: automation, tooling, and small improvements that remove friction.

I’m also very interested in security and digital privacy, and how they intersect with modern infrastructure and everyday engineering.

## What you’ll find here
- Notes on whatever I’m exploring (tech, security & privacy, finance, politics, sports, and more)
- Build logs and project writeups (what I built, trade-offs, results)
- Occasional updates
